/// Returns the sum 1 + 2 + ... + n
/// 
/// If n is less than 0, return -1
/// 
/// May use either a fixed equation to calculate the answer or an
/// iterative approach (though Gauss himself would likely prefer the
/// former...)

/// EXAMPLES:
/// gauss(5)  -> 15
/// gauss(10) -> 55
/// gauss(-2) -> -1

/// Returns a count of elements in `slice` of i32that satisfy:
///   lo <= x <= hi
/// Uses an iterator over the slice to ensure all elements are visited.

/// EXAMPLES:
/// in_range([5,2,1,3,9], 2, 5)  -> 3
/// in_range([5,2,1,3,9], 3, 4)  -> 1
/// in_range([5,2,1,3,9], 2, 10) -> 4

/// Calculates and returns the mean of elements in `slice` of floating
/// point values. To handle empty slices, this function returns an
/// Option: None for empty slices, and Some(mean) for filled slices.

/// EXAMPLES:
/// mean([])                     -> None
/// mean([10.0, 5.0, 7.0, 20.0]) -> Some(10.5)

/// Returns true if `slicea` is a subset of `sliceb` and false
/// otherwise. The function is generic so works with slices of any
/// type. The slices are not ordered so must be searched sequentially.

/// EXAMPLES:
///   subset([1,3,2], [1,2,3,4,5]) -> true
///   subset([1,3,2], [1,3,4,5])   -> false
///   subset(["a","c","d","c"], ["d","c","a"])     -> true
///   subset(["a","c","d","c"], ["d","c","a","r"]) -> true
///   subset(["a","q","d"],     ["d","c","a","r"]) -> false

/// by letting methods detect whether elements are contained or not.

/// Return a string showing the binary digits of the given unsigned
/// (positive) integer. Calculates the binary digits through repeated
/// division by 2 where the remainders become the digits in the binary
/// number. A survey of this method is here
/// https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/decimal-to-binary/
///
/// While converting, pushes digits of "0" or "1" into a container
/// type, vector being a good choice.  These digits need to be
/// reversed at the end of the computation (last digit found is most
/// significant, leftmost bit) so visits the digits in reverse order
/// in the container appending them to a String which is ultimately
/// returned.
///
/// No leading zeros are provided so the left-most character is always
/// a 1 EXCEPT in the special case of decimal value 0 which should
/// return the string "0".
/// 
/// EXAMPLES:
/// to_binstring(  0) ->         "0"
/// to_binstring(  2) ->        "10"
/// to_binstring(  9) ->      "1001"
/// to_binstring( 32) ->    "100000"

/// elements with row 0 being identical to the parameter r0_slice. A
/// vector or rows is allocated and each row is constructd as a
/// rotation left by i indices from the 0th row. The function is
/// generic and accepts any type that can be Cloned elements from
/// r0_slice must have clone() invoked on them to get a memory
/// distinct copy of them.
///
/// EXAMPLES:
/// 
/// circulant(&[1,2,3]) ->
///  [[1,2,3],
///   [2,3,1],
///   [3,1,2]]
///
/// circulant(&["a","b","c","d"]) ->

/// Returns a count of the number of "words" in `text`. The notion of
/// a word is a series of non-whitespace characters, (whitespace is
/// space, tab, newline). Regular expressions may be used for counting
/// words or character-by-character iteration to count whitespace
/// transitions. In either case, iteration through the string will be
/// required, either by regex match by direct iteration on the
/// characters.
/// 
/// NOTE: The Regular expression "crate" is marked as a dependency for
/// this project so will be downloaded HOWEVER you will need to add an
/// appropriate "use" statement to access its functionality here.
/// 
/// EXAMPLES:
/// count_words( &String::from("hello world"))                          -> 2
/// count_words( &String::from("       "))                              -> 0
