THE BEST OF EDSGER DIJKSTRA

Testing can only prove the presence of bugs, not their absence. 
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Conceptually FORTRAN remained on familiar grounds in the sense that
its purpose was to aid the mechanization of computational processes we
used to do with pen and paper (and mechanical desk calculators if you
could afford them). This was in strong contrast to LISP whose purpose
was to enable the execution of processes that no one would dream of
performing with pen and paper.
-- Edsger Dijkstra, Keynote address to be given on 1 March 1999 at the
   ACM Symposium on Applied Computing at San Antonio, TX

If in physics there's something you don't understand, you can always
hide behind the uncharted depths of nature. You can always blame
God. You didn't make it so complex yourself. But if your program
doesn't work, there is no one to hide behind. You cannot hide behind
an obstinate nature. If it doesn't work, you've messed up.
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Being abstract is something profoundly different from being
vague... The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create
a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
-- Edsger Dijsktra

Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
-- Edsger Dijsktra

Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a quality that decides
between success and failure
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could
only have originated in California.
-- Edsger Dijkstra

I don't know how many of you have ever met Dijkstra, but you probably
know that arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras.
-- Alan Kay
